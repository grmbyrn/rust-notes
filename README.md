# Rust Notes ðŸ¦€ðŸ“š

This repository contains structured notes for the [Rust Crash Course Tutorial for Beginners by Francesco Ciulla](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPoSdR46FgI412aItyJhj2bF66cudB6Qs). These notes are organized by chapter, with each chapter corresponding to a specific video from the playlist.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a complementary learning tool to the [Spaced Repetition App](https://github.com/grmbyrn/spaced-repetition-app). Students can use this repository to:

* Review concise, well-organized notes for each lesson.
* Reinforce their understanding through multiple choice questions in the app.
* Look up topics they are struggling with while practicing spaced repetition.

## How It Works

1. **Video Lessons**
   Follow the [Rust Crash Course Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPoSdR46FgI412aItyJhj2bF66cudB6Qs) video tutorials to learn Rust.

2. **Chapters & Notes**
   Each video corresponds to a chapter in this repository (e.g., `chapter-01`, `chapter-02`, etc.). Inside each chapter, you'll find markdown files containing:

   * Key concepts
   * Code examples
   * Summaries of important points

3. **Interactive Practice**
   Head over to the [Spaced Repetition App](https://github.com/grmbyrn/spaced-repetition-app) to test your knowledge with multiple choice questions based on these notes.
